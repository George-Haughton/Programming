## Algorithm
An Algorithm is a formula that solves a problem, based on completing/conducting a sequence of outlined actions. Firstly, there are 5 important stages of building an App. The first stage is the Pre-production stage, where you will brainstorm and document every aspect of how your app works. The ideas you will brainstorm will consist of what is your expected users, what experience you would like your users to have and what the overall outcomes you expect from the user using the app. Secondly we have stage 2 which is about ‘telling your story’, after we have a basic idea of what we want the app to consist of we now need to make a low-fidelity storyboard detailing scene by scene of the app. This stage will not look aesthetically good, but it will outline the key points of the app, such as the flow of it, how it works, the logic behind the app and will give you a good idea of what the app actually is. This stage is very important and should not be rushed as it is the base foundations of your app and should be looked at it high detail, involving as many people as you can. Thirdly, the visual design stage. This is where you will create the look and feel of your app. For example, creating the UI (user interface) elements (how the user will navigate their way around your app), the transitions between scenes, the design of each page (how the text it positioned, what colours are you going to use and what images) and finally what interactive component are going to be used on each page, but we do not make any code all we are doing is building an idea of how the app works and how it’s going to look. The fourth stage is the coding/programming of the app which is arguably the most important stage, when coding an app, you will need to choose a preferred platform you would like the app to start on then after you have perfected the first platform you can move onto others. This is a good way of keeping the job easy for yourself as trying to get an app up and running on both platforms at the same time can be a difficult task. During this process you will be constantly adjusting the code to make sure no bugs develop and to make sure the code works completely without any mishaps. With this stage it can take longer than intended because of the bugs and things of this nature stopping the app from progressing. Finally, we have the launch stage where we will have to speak to companies about putting the app on their platforms and prices and things of this nature. As with any app the general public might find bugs and problems with the app you and your company did not consider or find, and this is where the continuous running of the app, and continuous updates will need to keep happening to make sure the app is always at a standard the users are happy with and they are not any problems that stop the users using the app in its intended way.
